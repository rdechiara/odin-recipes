                    To prepare the Catalan salad, start by eliminating the final, white and hard part. The amount of waste depends a lot on personal tastes, the central rib is the hardest and generally less appreciated. Remove the damaged leaves and wash the catalonia carefully. Break it into several parts and place it on a basket to steam it, or blanch it in a little water. Save the cooking water for another preparation or to add part of it to a vegetable broth.

                    Let it cool and then season with oil, lemon, salt and a nice grind of pepper. Serve the Catalan salad, a concentrate of health!
