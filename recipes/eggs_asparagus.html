                    To prepare eggs and asparagus, start cleaning the asparagus: remove the white part by breaking them with your hands (if they are fresh they will split in the right place) or use a knife. Steam them for 10 minutes, but check them often, they must remain crunchy and not overcook. Once cooked, quickly pass them in a pan with a little butter. Keep them aside.

                    In the same pan, melt a knob of butter. Break the two eggs carefully and do not turn them, but cover them with a lid so that they cook without the risk of breaking. Salt and pepper. Arrange the asparagus on a plate and lay the eggs on top. Complete the preparation of the eggs and asparagus with a generous grating of cheese and serve.
